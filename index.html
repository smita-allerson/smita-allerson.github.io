        <h2 class="about-me">About Me</h2>
        <p class="about-me">
          I am an energetic and driven professional with management experience.
          With four years in college admissions and financial aid, I am skilled
          in presentations, communication, data management, organization, and
          recruitment. I am experienced in growing a small business, having
          managed the transition of the family business, GurramTax, from an
          in-home operation to a thriving small business with 7 employees. I
          look to challenge myself, continuously learn, and work towards a
          positive impact in my community.
